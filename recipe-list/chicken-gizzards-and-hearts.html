        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Chicken gizzards and hearts might not be a dish everyone eats or makes, they may not sound appealing to many
            but for those that do, this recipe is for you.
            I grew up eating them a lot, my mom not only made them as a separate dish, but also added them to varies other dishes.
            A few that i remember the most were soups, braised cabbage and baked potatoes.
            Because i ate them often while growing up, i still make them from time to time now for my little family as well and this recipe
            is my favorite way to cook them because of how tender they turn out to be.
